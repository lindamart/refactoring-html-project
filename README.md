# refactoring-html-project



In this project I reviewed existing code and worked on refactoring HTML and CSS code.

Refacting details:

HTML
- Cleaned up code by repacing divs with cleaner semantic elements such as header, nav, main, aside, section, and footer.
- Added alt attributes to all image elements.
- Added id attribute to first navbar item so it would correctly link to the section further down the page.
- Added title to title element.
- Changed footer header tag from h2 to h4.
- Moved stylesheet link below title element.

CSS
- Removed and condensed class selectors on elements that included the same styling.
- Updated condensed elements by using the broader semantic elements so  styles once on the stylesheet
